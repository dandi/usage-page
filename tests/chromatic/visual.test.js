 * These are per-test rather than per-project because Chromatic keys an archive
 * by the test's title alone: run as Playwright projects, each viewport writes
 * over the last one's manifest and only the project that runs last reaches
 * Chromatic at all.  Naming the viewport in the test title keeps them apart.
